##  Correlation
* Defines the relationship between two variables that is how the two variables are linked with each other
* **Correlation test** is used to evaluate the association between two or more variables.

## Methods for corelation analysis
* **Pearson correlation** (r), which measures a linear dependence between two variables (x and y). Itâ€™s also known as a parametric correlation test because it depends to the distribution of the data. It can be used only when x and y are from normal distribution. The plot of y = f(x) is named the linear regression curve.
* Kendall tau and Spearman rho, which are rank-based correlation coefficients (non-parametric)
